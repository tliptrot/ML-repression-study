# Project description in brief

I'm currently organizing a research project examining the risks of AI-improved repression. Increased internet usage opens the possibilities for the state to survey  social group membership. political actions and even attitude statements. Combining that mass surveillance with predictive algorithms could enable repressive actors to engage in new coercive activities and automate expensive repressive actions. To understand these risks, We will use social cohesion surveys conducted in authoritarian states and split/train/test predictive models on political attitudes which rely on different data sets (set of non-political beliefs, set of social group memberships etc.).
